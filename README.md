# D_FAST_all

D_FAST_all is a Python-based project designed to run on the PyCharm platform, implementing a feature extraction and similarity search algorithm for seismic signal detection. This project integrates the D_FAST algorithm and includes a dataset in the Releases directory under `PNWData1`. D_FAST is a waveform-based detection method inspired by Philips' audio fingerprinting algorithm, offering improved detection speed and reduced memory usage compared to the original FAST algorithm. D_FAST maintains strong noise resilience and performs well even under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

### Data Structure in PNWData1
The `PNWData1` folder in `Releases` contains the primary dataset, including raw seismic data and preprocessed data from the PNW dataset:
- **catalag/**: Contains directories for earthquake and noise event types.
- **earthquake/** and **explosion/**: Store waveform data from various stations.
  - **original/**: Holds raw waveform data in `.pkl` format.
  - **P_waveform/**: Contains preprocessed waveforms in `.npy` format (filtered and extracted based on P-wave arrival).
  - **fp/** and **fp_fast/**: Store binary fingerprints generated by D_FAST and FAST algorithms.
  - **waveform_plot/** and **spectrogram_plot/**: Store original waveform and spectrogram plots.
  - **noise/**: Contains noise waveform data and associated fingerprints.

To download the dataset, visit [PNW-ML](https://github.com/niyiyu/PNW-ML). Use the preprocessing scripts in `preprocess/` to filter and prepare the raw waveform data for analysis.

## Functionality Overview

### LEDS Folder
- **LEDS.py**: Extracts features to generate binary fingerprints. Takes waveform data in `.npy` format from the input folder and stores the resulting fingerprints in the output folder.
- **pair_sim_calculate.py**: Calculates pairwise similarity of fingerprints.
- **result_plot.py**: Visualizes similarity distribution of fingerprints to validate the fingerprint extraction effectiveness.

### WMPLSH Folder
- **index_table.py**: Generates a hash index table for use in similarity searches.
- **wmplsh.py**: Executes similarity searches and summarizes detection statistics.
- **Roc_plot.py**: Plots detection results using ROC curves.

### FAST Folder
- **Fingerprint_Extraction.py**: Implements the original FAST algorithm for generating sparse binary fingerprints.
- **LSH.py**: Conducts similarity searches using the FAST algorithm.
- **evalution.py**: Compares the performance of D_FAST against FAST and visualizes results.
